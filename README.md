Hey, idk what should be written herer for this project).
Just simple HTTP echo server example with correct (I hope) interface way DI: extending/mocking and etc.
Server starts on localhost:8080. Project structure doesn't ideal, but show us main idea of injecting/distribution of different domain sectors.

Examples:

GET: curl localhost:8080/dictionary/someKey

POST:  curl -X POST -d 'key=anotherKey&value=oleg' localhost:8080/dictionary
